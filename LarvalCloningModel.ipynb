    "# Demographic implications of cloning in marine invertebrate larvae \n",
    "This is a graphical interface for using the `clone_modelND` (for Non-Dimensional) model of cloning in marine invertebrate larvae. The `clone_modelND` model calculates the size distribution of a cohort of marine invertebrate larvae over time. This cohort represents a group of larvae beginning development at the same time and at the same size. For example, the cohort could represent larvae from the eggs of a single mother, or larvae from the eggs of a local population of mothers that spawn synchronously at a given time and place.\n",
    "\n",
    "In \"normal\" development (without cloning), a cohort of larvae always decreases in population due to mortality, because there is no mechanism for adding new larvae to the cohort. In a cloning species, one larva can divide into two genetically identical \"daughter\" larvae. This means that, in cloning larvae, the number of larvae in a cohort can either increase or decrease at any given time during development.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Like most larval life history models in the literature, **size is assumed in the** `clone_modelND` **model to be a *proxy* for developmental state**. This means that the model does not represent developmental state directly. Instead, it assumes that developmental state is closely coupled to size. For example, a larva is assumed to be competent to settle when it reaches a specific size. This approach means that the model does not exactly describe many details of morphology and life history associated with any given species. However, the more general results of this modeling approach may approximately describe a great many different species.\n",
    "\n",
    "While cloning produces two larvae out of one, it does not provide any additional tissue or nutritional resources to those larvae. This means a larva that clones produces two daughter larvae that are smaller. The model assumes that the daughter larvae divide the resources from the original larva. Hence, **the sizes of two daughters produced by cloning add up to the size of the original larva.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, some marine invertebrate larvae simply bifurcate during development, dividing their tissue into two parts. Each of these parts can either redifferentiate into a complete, smaller larva, or resume growing to reform the lost body parts. Whether it redifferentiates or regrows lost parts, a clone has to grow back to a size at which it is capable of metamorphosis (or of cloning again). The model neglects this difference in developmental mode of clones: Consistent with using size as a proxy, the model treats all larvae of size $s$ the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model can simulate characteristics of two distinct modes of cloning, exemplified by cloning typically found in Echinoids and Ophiuroids:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the **Echinoid mode** of cloning, larvae grow and develop to a threshold size smaller than the size at metamorphosis. At this threshold size, some fraction of individuals clone to form two smaller daughters. These clones resume growth, and either clone again when they reach the threshold size or proceed to metamorphosis. Clones resume growth, and either clone again when they reach the threshold size or proceed to metamorphosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the **Ophiuroid mode** of cloning, a fraction of surviving larvae grow past the size at metamorphosis. These larger larvae then divide into two clones, one of which metamorphoses immediately. The other, smaller clone then resumes development, repeating growth and either metamorphosing directly or cloning again to form a metamorph and yet another small clone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `clone_modelND` model is capable of modeling many scenarios, such as fluctuating environments or multiple potential cloning or metamorphosis sizes, that are not implemented through this Jupyter NoteBook interface. These can be accessed by running the model directly from Python."

    "## Model structure and parameters\n",
    "The `clone_modelND` model has two independent variables: larval size, $s$, and time, $t$. It has one dependent variable: $p(s,t)$, the population of larvae of size $s$ at time $t$. \n",

    " \n",
    "- **Larval mortality**\n",
    "    - $m_0$ determines the basal mortality rate.\n",
    "    - $\\alpha$ determines the *size-dependence* of mortality, e.g. due to predators that preferentially prey on early or late stage larvae ($\\alpha<0$ means mortality is higher for early stages; $\\alpha>0$ means mortality is higher for late stages; $\\alpha=0$ means mortality is the same for all stages).  \n",

    "     \n",
    "- **Sizes for developmental milestones**\n",
    "    - $s_{egg}$ determines egg size (starting size for a developing larva)\n",

    "    - $s_1$ determines the size of one clone (must have $s_1<s_0$). The other clone has size $s_0-s_1$.\n",
    "    - $s_2$ is the size at metamorphosis\n",
    "    - $s_{max}$ determines the upper limit of the population size structure plot. It has no effect on the simulation itself.\n",
    "     \n",
    "- **Probabilities for developmental milestones**\n",
    "    - $c_0$ is the probability a larva will clone when it reaches size $s_1$. $c_0=0$ means larvae never clone. $c_0 = 0.5$ means 50% of larvae clone, etc.\n",
    "    - $f_2$ is the probability of metamorphosis at size $s_2$. $f_2=1$ means larvae always metamorphose when they reach size at metamorphosis. $f_2 = 0.5$ means 50% of larvae metamorphose when they reach size at metamorphosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *initial condition* -- the size distribution at the beginning of a simulation -- is that all larvae are initially of size $s_0$. Because there are only a fixed amount of maternal resources to put into eggs, making larger eggs means there are initially fewer, larger larvae. Conversely, making smaller eggs means there are initially more, smaller larvae."
